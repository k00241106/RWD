		<p>Dublin's seven-time All-Ireland-winning forward Eoghan O'Gara has announced his retirement from inter-county football.
		O'Gara, 34, won the 2008 All-Ireland JFC title alongside Darren Daly, Michael Fitzsimons, Denis Bastick and Jonny Cooper.
		He made debut for the seniors in the National League that same year and was a member of the panel that won the Leinster SFC that summer under Pillar Caffrey.
		He would go on to play a part in the Sky Blues' final triumphs of 2011, 2013, 2016 and 2017 and was an unused sub in the 2018 defeat of Tyrone. He did not make the panel for either the drawn decider or subsequent replay against Kerry this year, with his last appearance for the Dubs coming in August when he scored the only goal of the game in a 1-16 to 0-13 Super 8s victory against Tyrone.
		The Templeogue Synge Street man now follows Bernard Brogan into the sunset with seven All-Ireland, ten Leinster and five league winners' medals on the mantelpiece
		"I have spent 11 years living out my dreams as a kid growing up in this great city," O'Gara said in a statement
		"As I call an end to what has been the most phenomenal experience of my life I would like to thank the following.
		"My parents and my nine siblings for shaping me and giving me the burning desire to never give up on that dream. My extended family for the constant unwavering support.
		"My club Templeogue Synge Street for their never-ending support and guidance from so many generous and selfless people along the way since I was eight-years-old. Joe O'Reilly, Philip Murphy and the late Vincent Walsh who mentored me and gave me the grá for Gaelic football and belief in myself.
		"To 'The Blue Panther' Anton O’Toole, a man who inspired me and showed me the way to the top via my actions, not my words. A man who embodied all the values a sportsperson and a person should have.
		"To get to follow in his footsteps and then share the field with my club-mates Denis (Bastick) and Niall (Scully) in a blue jersey was an absolute honour and privilege.
		"To my partner Elaine for all the many sacrifices, putting her life on hold and giving me whatever time and space I ever needed to chase that dream and for putting up with me along the way. Thank you. My two beautiful daughters, Ella and Fiadh, who kept me motivated and for always having my back and making me smile.
		"To 'Pillar', Pat Gilroy and Jim Gavin who all had faith in me and helped me improve as a player and a person and whose love for Dublin GAA was infectious.
		"To every member of the Dublin senior football management and medical team during my time who always went beyond the call of duty whenever required.
		"Thanks to the many passionate and loyal Dublin supporters who always made their presence felt hail, rain or shine and whose pride in us always added extra motivation.
		"The people I have shared it with, and the experiences I have shared with them, have made me a better person and given me the tools to grow more than I ever thought possible. 
		"To every one of my team-mates past and present, the brothers and family I was lucky to spend so much time with and to get to know and go to battle with. Men, characters and leaders of the very highest calibre.
		"There aren't words to describe my gratitude and love for you. Some great friends I hope to keep for a very long time." </p>
