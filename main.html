		<p>Two inter-county players have yet to respond to claims they were sent home early from a hurling tournament in America last weekend after one of them filmed the other engaged in a New York City street brawl.
		The controversy arose after one player allegedly recorded the other fighting with a supporter on a street in the Big Apple last Friday night.
		Both players are former All Ireland winning medalists.
		In a statement via on its official Twitter account this afternoon, Limerick GAA stated: “Limerick GAA can confirm it sent home two panelists early from last weekend’s New York hurling Classic following an incident.
		“Limerick GAA expects the highest standards of behaviour and example from its players, both on and off the field, and will not tolerate any breach of those standards.
		“A disciplinary process has commenced and there will be no further comment in relation to this matter."The player it is alleged was involved in recording or sharing the video did not comment when approached and asked for comment.
		A representative from this player’s club could not be reached despite numerous attempts to contact them by telephone.
		Meanwhile, the player who it has been alleged was fighting with a supporter in New York did not respond to a request for comment via his personal Twitter account.
		A source at this player’s club said yesterday and again today that they had “no comment” to make about the controversy when they were contacted.
		Efforts to contact the player through his club were not successful.
		The club source said they had “not met the player” in question and they had “not spoken to him”</p>
